# Abstract
> Our key findings are three-fold. First, the minimum DDoS attack rate causing service disruptions varies significantly 
among different IoT smart home devices, and buffer overflow within the victim device is validated as critical. 
Second, the group key updating process of WiFi, may facilitate DDoS attacks by causing faster victim disconnections. 
Third, a higher E-DDoS attack rate sent by the attacker may not necessarily lead to a victim’s higher energy consumption. 
Our study reveals the communication protocols, attack rates, payload sizes, and victim devices’ ports state as the vital 
factors to determine the energy consumption of victim devices. These findings facilitate a thorough understanding of 
IoT devices’ potential vulnerabilities within a smart home environment and pave solid foundations for future studies on 
defense solutions
