Hi, I'm Bhagyashri Tushir—a curious and passionate computer scientist with a deep love for machine learning, NLP, and IoT.
With a Ph.D. in Computer Science & Engineering and over seven years of experience, I have had the privilege of diving 
into some of the most exciting challenges in technology today. Throughout my career, I've found joy in solving complex 
problems, whether it's enhancing the performance of IoT devices or developing intelligent systems that make our smart 
homes safer and more efficient. I have always been fascinated by how technology can transform lives, and I’m driven by a 
desire to push the boundaries of what's possible.

My journey has taken me through roles as an Software Engineer and Researcher, where I've collaborated with amazing teams 
and mentored budding engineers—experiences that have been incredibly rewarding. I’ve worked on projects ranging from fine-tuning
machine learning models to designing scalable cloud solutions, always with a focus on real-world impact. Beyond the technical 
achievements, what really excites me is the potential of technology to make a difference. Whether through my published research 
or the solutions I've developed, I aim to contribute to a future where technology not only advances but also serves the greater
good.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science & Engineering from Santa Clara University, CA, USA, where I had the privilege 
of working under the guidance of Dr. Yuhong Liu and Dr. Behnam Dezfouli. My M.S. degree in Computer Science and Engineering
was earned at Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Delhi, India, under the mentorship of Dr. Sanjay K. Dhurandher. 
I also hold a B.E. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Delhi, India.

Outside of work, I’m always on the lookout for new ideas and opportunities to learn. I believe in the power of collaboration
and am always open to connecting with like-minded individuals who share a passion for innovation and making the world a
better place. Thanks for stopping by—let’s connect and see how we can create something amazing together!
