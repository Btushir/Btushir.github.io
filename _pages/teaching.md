At Santa Clara University, CA, I worked as a Teaching Assistant for courses like Operating Systems, Computer Networks, 
C++, and Advanced Web Architecture. I really enjoyed holding office hours where I could help students one-on-one with 
tough concepts. I also put together slides to make the material easier to understand. 
This experience not only let me support the students but also helped me get a deeper grasp of the subjects myself
